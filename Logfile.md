## Day 1 [9-june-2018]
It was a great day, most of the time I spend to decide scope and features of the re-tweet bot.  Once I did with that I started to read about similar bots and searched for twitter suggested Golang packages.  I decided to use Anaconda and begin to code.  I coded the search and retweet part of the bot. For next few days, I'll work on the same project and improve its features.

## Day 2 [10-june-2018]
I woke up excited to work on my Retweet Bot. I already did with setup and today's task was clear in my mind. First of all, I arranged the code in the modular and structured way, then began to code for following back option.
As more as I am working on its new features and improvement with code coming to mind. for next few days improve it more and try to add more features to it.

## Day 3 [11-june-2018]
Yesterday night after pushing my code to Github I sent it for the review to one of Golang master. He suggested me to use Golang Meta Linter from the initialization of project.  Today I followed his advice and used Golang Meta linter and found the errors with code. I fixed them all and learned about linting. Tomorrow I'll again work on the features of ReTweet Bot.
