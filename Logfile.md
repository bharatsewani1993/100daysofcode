## Day 1 [9-june-2018]
It was a great day, most of the time I spend to decide scope and features of the re-tweet bot.  Once I did with that I started to read about similar bots and searched for twitter suggested Golang packages.  I decided to use Anaconda and begin to code.  I coded the search and retweet part of the bot. For next few days, I'll work on the same project and improve its features.
