## Day 1 [9-june-2018]
It was a great day, most of the time I spend to decide scope and features of the re-tweet bot.  Once I did with that I started to read about similar bots and searched for twitter suggested Golang packages.  I decided to use Anaconda and begin to code.  I coded the search and retweet part of the bot. For next few days, I'll work on the same project and improve its features.

## Day 2 [10-june-2018]
I woke up excited to work on my Retweet Bot. I already did with setup and today's task was clear in my mind. First of all, I arranged the code in the modular and structured way, then began to code for following back option.
As more as I am working on its new features and improvement with code coming to mind. for next few days improve it more and try to add more features to it.

## Day 3 [11-june-2018]
Yesterday night after pushing my code to Github I sent it for the review to one of Golang master. He suggested me to use Golang Meta Linter from the initialization of project.  Today I followed his advice and used Golang Meta linter and found the errors with code. I fixed them all and learned about linting. Tomorrow I'll again work on the features of ReTweet Bot.

## Day 5 [13-june-2018]
Today I worked to fix bug on existing code.  Added feature to follow and greet only new users. Created function to find the difference between two slice elements. Worked with database queries and tried to create batch update and insert queries to update multiple data in one shot.

## Day 6 [14-june-2018]
Today I worked to do only new and unique retweets. I finished all the features of the bot, for next few days I'll work on the cron job and testing of the bot. I'll try to add CI/Cd with it.

## Day 7 [15-june-2018]
Yesterday, I shared the bot on social media sites with the description of it.  I got 40 followers and some of them were bot followers which were automatically following the account and once the account user follows them back they unfollow the user. [Example Account](https://twitter.com/deadat0)  Today I code to unfollow such accounts. [Link](https://github.com/bharatsewani1993/ReTweetBot/commit/554b88d2f5a6c902b92afc600955a49125fec89c)

## Day 8 [16-june-2018]
Tonight I was surfing through Github repositories and looking for an issue to fix in them. I found a simple open typo issue on https://github.com/astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang . I forked the repository and fixed the bug and submitted it for verify. I created the cron job for my Golangjob Retweet bot it will execute it in every 6 hours.  Today I started to plan for my next Golang project and begin to work on it.

## Day 9 [17-june-2018]
Today I decided to build a simple web application with Golang. I created a simple web server with it and tried to learn about the template. I spend lots of time on Golang Template and tried many tutorials but got no luck to implement it as I wanted to implement. I'll learn more about it and create a simple third party API integration with it.

## Day 10 [18-June-2018]
I wanted to use a predefined theme for this application, I spend a lot of time to setup it with Golang but it was crashing and was not resulting in the rendering on the browser.  I decided to move ahead by creating own view with simple HTML. Loaded the Login page, with Ajax send data to the server, done form validation and created a function to connect to the database. I'll continue to work on login and send the message for next few days.

## Day 11 [23-June-2018]
I completed the send message process of the application using Twilio API. I was unable to code for four days in past so decided to code two hours each day for next two days.

## Day 12 [24-june-2018]
I decided to create a new repository and add all the slice functions into it. For next few days, I'll practise functions and try with different slice/array functions.
[Repository Link](https://github.com/bharatsewani1993/slicefunctions)

## Day 13 [25-june-2018]
I spend about one hour to work on array function but still not got the desired result. I'll work on it for next few days.
[Repository Link](https://github.com/bharatsewani1993/slicefunctions/commit/c43ce6276a992a0f592e8b8e9952e0ec3f310558)

## Day 14 [28-june-2018]
I come from the PHP background where we already have plenty of array functions to perform array operations.  But in case of Golang its really raw and don't have such facilities in it. From last some days, I was struggling to write effective code for Array_chunk and finally today I made it done.
I'll continue my practice for the day and try to Implement more functions in it. [Repository Link](https://github.com/bharatsewani1993/slicefunctions/commit/0956155a83b96dfffff5c70b3313e3b028078e11)

Edit: I worked more on it and created 5 new array functions.

## Day 15 [29-june-2018]
It was a good day to practise Golang, I learned new things.
Used 3rd party JSON API to fetch user location, timezone and other information via his/her IP address.

## Day 16 [7-july-2018]
I missed the logs of many days and someday didn't coded enough. It was a Saturday Morning and start of a new weekend. I get started with Email Script and CSV Reading and Writing Script with Golang.
[Email Script](https://github.com/bharatsewani1993/Golangemail)

[CSV Reading Writing](https://github.com/bharatsewani1993/golangcsv)

## Day 17 [9-july-2018]
Yesterday, I contributed to an open source project was not able to code in Golang. Today I used [Imaging](https://github.com/disintegration/imaging) package to do image processing with Golang. I'll try to keep my streak continue for next seven days.

## Day 18 [10-july-2018]
For the day I worked with language detection with Golang.
I used a third party package Getlang to perform actions.

### Day 19 [11-july-2018]
Today I tried to work on an open source project [Getlang](https://github.com/rylans/getlang). I added Punjabi language support to it and created a pull request. My code failed with Tarvis CI test cases so for the next day, I'll try to improve my code and try to resubmit pull request.

### Day 20 [12-july-2018]
I continued the yesterday's work and tried to fix the bugs in my previous code. Today It passed all the test cases and owner merged my pull request to the repository. Now I am officially a contributor to [Getlang](https://github.com/rylans/getlang).

### Day 21 [13-July-2018]
I added Kannada language support to the open source package and created the pull request. The owner accepted and merged it with the master repository.[Getlang](https://github.com/rylans/getlang/commit/bc10a4549029b385278b0a50a1ffd92a2955a54d)

### Day 22 [14-July-2018]
